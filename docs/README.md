# Documentation

I store documentation files here so I can write and edit them in [Obsidian](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/tag/obsidian/). Links below are what you can find here:

- [Development log](https://github.com/joshcanhelp/api-getter/blob/main/docs/devlog.md) - Probably more useful to me than you. These are the notes I've been taking while building this system, separated by day. These link out to documents in the folder below.
- [Decisions](https://github.com/joshcanhelp/api-getter/blob/main/docs/decisions/) - Design decisions ([ADRs](https://adr.github.io)) considered during the development of this project.
