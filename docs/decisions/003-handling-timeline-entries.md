# Handling manual timeline entries

## Status

`DRAFT`

## Context

Moment-in-time/on-this-day functionality requires some manual entry for specific life events that fall outside of your imported data. Things like:

- moving dates (new physical location and address)
- jobs (start and end dates)
- vacations
- marriage/relationship milestones
- kid milestones

So we need a way to capture these that can be incorporated into the matrix of data that we're pulling down and importing.

## Consequences

- Building out functionality that's not a core part of this system

## Decision

> What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
