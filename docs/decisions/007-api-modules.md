# API contract modules and contribution

## Status

`DRAFT`

## Context

- API contracts should be easy to add with as little boilerplate as possible
- The process to write, test, and submit new contracts should be clear and straightforward with excellent docs
- A class that extends a single base class feels like a good structure but I want it to be as idiomatic as possible and OOP in JS is controversial
- I want TS to handle as much of the heavy lifting as possible in terms of finding potential problems and defects
