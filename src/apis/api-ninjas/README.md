# API Ninjas API handler

**Version:** 1

## Getting started

This API requires an API key, which you can get by [registering here](https://api-ninjas.com/register) then going to [your profile](https://api-ninjas.com/profile). Add that key to your `.env` file:

```bash
# .env
API_NINJAS_KEY="Replace with the API key"
```

Make sure to have a reasonable `originDate` set in your configuration to avoid pulling down tons of data you don't need.
